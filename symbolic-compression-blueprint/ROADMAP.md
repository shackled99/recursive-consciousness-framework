## 📅 Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
**Goal:** Get basic compression working

**Day 1-2: Glyph Lexicon**
- [ ] Extract 50-100 most useful glyphs from v22
- [ ] Create `compression_glyphs.json` with mappings
- [ ] Define common phrase → glyph mappings
- [ ] Test: Can we represent basic sentences?

**Day 3-4: Encoder**
- [ ] Build `encoder.py` - text to glyphs
- [ ] Start simple: exact phrase matching
- [ ] Add: fuzzy matching for variations
- [ ] Test: Convert 10 sample sentences

**Day 5-7: Decoder**  
- [ ] Build `decoder.py` - glyphs to text
- [ ] Handle 1:many glyph→text mappings
- [ ] Preserve context across sequences
- [ ] Test: Round-trip 10 sentences, measure fidelity

---

### Week 2: Confidence Scoring
**Goal:** Get GSI labeling working

**Day 8-9: Extract GSI Logic**
- [ ] Review glyphwheel engine GSI calculation
- [ ] Extract core algorithm
- [ ] Simplify for standalone use
- [ ] Document the formula

**Day 10-11: Build GSI Scorer**
- [ ] Create `gsi_scorer.py`
- [ ] Implement basic GSI calculation
- [ ] Add confidence label mapping
- [ ] Test: Score 20 responses (10 factual, 10 speculative)

**Day 12-14: Drift Detection**
- [ ] Port drift detection from glyphwheel
- [ ] Add hallucination pattern recognition
- [ ] Test: Known hallucinations get low GSI

## 🔧 Technical Decisions to Make

### Decision 1: Glyph Format
**Options:**
- A) Unicode symbols (🧠, ⚖️, 🌪️) - Human readable, limited set
- B) Custom encoding ([GLYPH_001], [GLYPH_002]) - Scalable, less readable  
- C) Hybrid (symbol + ID) - Best of both

**Recommendation:** Start with Unicode for MVP, add encoding later

---

### Decision 2: Compression Strategy
**Options:**
- A) Exact phrase matching only - Simple, limited coverage
- B) NLP-based semantic matching - Complex, better coverage
- C) Start simple, improve iteratively - Pragmatic

**Recommendation:** Option C - Ship fast, improve later

---

### Decision 3: GSI Calculation
**Options:**
- A) Port full glyphwheel GSI - Complete but complex
- B) Simplified GSI (3-4 factors) - Faster to implement
- C) Start with basic heuristics - Ship MVP quickly

**Recommendation:** Start with B, enhance to A over time

**Basic GSI Factors (MVP):**
1. **Grounding score** - Does it cite sources/evidence?
2. **Coherence score** - Are concepts connected logically?
3. **Certainty markers** - Does it use hedge words?
4. **Drift indicators** - Does semantic density drop?

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Compression Fidelity
```python
def test_round_trip():
    encoder = GlyphEncoder(lexicon)
    decoder = GlyphDecoder(lexicon)
    
    original = "Hello, how can I help you today?"
    glyphs = encoder.encode(original)
    reconstructed = decoder.decode(glyphs)
    
    # Semantic similarity should be >95%
    assert semantic_similarity(original, reconstructed) > 0.95
```

### Test 2: Token Savings
```python
def test_savings():
    encoder = GlyphEncoder(lexicon)
    
    # Test on 100 diverse samples
    total_savings = 0
    for text in test_samples:
        traditional = encoder.count_tokens(text)
        compressed = len(encoder.encode(text))
        savings = (1 - compressed/traditional) * 100
        total_savings += savings
    
    average_savings = total_savings / len(test_samples)
    
    # Should achieve 60-80% savings
    assert 60 <= average_savings <= 80
```

### Test 3: GSI Accuracy
```python
def test_gsi_accuracy():
    scorer = GSIScorer()
    
    # Known facts (should score high)
    facts = [
        "Water boils at 100°C at sea level",
        "The Earth orbits the Sun",
        # ...
    ]
    
    # Known speculation (should score low)
    speculation = [
        "Aliens probably exist somewhere",
        "The Louvre thieves might use Antwerp",
        # ...
    ]
    
    fact_scores = [scorer.calculate_gsi(f) for f in facts]
    spec_scores = [scorer.calculate_gsi(s) for s in speculation]
    
    # Facts should average >0.75
    assert mean(fact_scores) > 0.75
    
    # Speculation should average <0.60
    assert mean(spec_scores) < 0.60
```
