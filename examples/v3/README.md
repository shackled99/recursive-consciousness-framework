# ðŸŒŸ Glyphwheel Forecast Engine - Working Prototype

## What This Is
Your complete, working Glyphwheel system with a beautiful web interface! This takes your original concepts and makes them interactive and visual.

## How to Use (Super Simple!)

### Option 1: Double-Click to Run
- Just double-click `START_GLYPHWHEEL.bat`
- Your browser will open automatically
- Start experimenting!

### Option 2: Run from Command Line
- Double-click `glyphwheel_app.py`
- Or open terminal and type: `python glyphwheel_app.py`

## What You'll See
- **Real-time glyph visualization** - See your glyphs change and adapt
- **Interactive controls** - Run stress tests, add new glyphs
- **Live metrics** - Watch coherence, entropy, and system state
- **System logs** - See what's happening in real-time
- **Safety protocols** - Your consent mechanisms are active

## Features That Work Right Now
âœ… **Antifragile behavior** - Glyphs get stronger under stress  
âœ… **Consent protocols** - Ethical safeguards prevent harmful operations  
âœ… **Recovery systems** - Automatic healing and stabilization  
âœ… **Real-time monitoring** - Live system metrics and logs  
âœ… **Interactive stress testing** - See how your system responds  
âœ… **Dynamic glyph creation** - Add new glyphs on the fly  

## Your Original Concepts in Action
- **GSI (Glyph Stability Index)** - Each glyph has a stability rating that adapts
- **Antifragile Systems** - Stress makes the system stronger, not weaker
- **Recursive Depth** - The system can handle complex recursive operations
- **Entropy Management** - System maintains organization despite chaos
- **Safety Protocols** - Consent mechanisms protect system integrity

## Files Explained
- `glyphwheel_app.py` - Your main Glyphwheel engine (the brain)
- `web_interface.py` - The beautiful web UI (the face)
- `START_GLYPHWHEEL.bat` - Easy launcher (just double-click!)
- `glyphwheelpython.py` - Your original code (backup)

## Troubleshooting
- If port 8080 is busy, the app will tell you to try a different port
- If browser doesn't open, manually go to: http://localhost:8080
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the server

## What's Different from Your Original Code
- Added a beautiful web interface
- Real-time visualization of glyphs
- Interactive controls for experiments
- Live system monitoring
- Simplified while keeping all your core concepts
